Successful transfer and testing in QA are crucial before the deployment to production.",

This step involves transferring validated and approved data from the QA environment to Production. This is the final step in the deployment pipeline, where the features become live and available to end-users. Rigorous validation in QA helps minimize risks associated with deploying to Production.",

This step allows for addressing any issues or making further enhancements before potentially redeploying to QA or Production. It ensures that feedback from Production can be incorporated into future development cycles."
